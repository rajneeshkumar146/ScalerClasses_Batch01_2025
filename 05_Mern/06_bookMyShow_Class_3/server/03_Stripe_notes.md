## Stripe is an online payment processing platform that enables businesses to accept payments over the internet. It provides a suite of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allows developers to integrate payment processing into websites and mobile applications easily. Here are some key aspects of Stripe:


## Visit (https://stripe.com/in) webiste and log yourself in , after that make sure to generate your API keys - there will be two keys , one will be publishable key and another will be secret key , Generate both of them

## In Stripe, the publishable key and secret key are both essential for securely integrating Stripe's payment services into your website or application:

## Publishable Key:

    The publishable key is used on the client-side (in the browser or mobile app) to identify your Stripe account when making API requests.

    It is safe to expose this key in your frontend code (e.g., JavaScript), as it does not grant access to sensitive actions like issuing refunds or viewing transactions.

    Its primary purpose is to initialize Stripe.js (Stripe's JavaScript library) on the client side and to generate secure tokens for handling payment details securely.

## Secret Key:

    The secret key, also known as the API key, is used on the server-side of your application to authenticate API requests to Stripe.

    This key must be kept confidential and should never be exposed in frontend code or client-side applications.

    It grants full access to your Stripe account, including the ability to perform actions like processing charges, creating refunds, managing subscriptions, and accessing sensitive data.
