## What is a Rate Limiter?

A rate limiter is a mechanism used to control the number of requests a client can make to a server within a specific time frame. This helps to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect the server from being overwhelmed by too many requests in a short period. Rate limiting is commonly used to:

    1. Prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: By limiting the number of requests, the server can avoid being overwhelmed by malicious users.

    2. Manage API usage: Ensures that no single user consumes too many resources, ensuring fair usage across all users.

    3. Reduce server load: Helps in managing server load and ensuring consistent performance.

    4. Enhance security: Protects against brute-force attacks, where an attacker tries to guess credentials by making multiple requests.
