1. In Node.js, an Event Emitter is a special type of class that allows objects to communicate with each other by emitting events and listening for them. Think of it as a system for sending and receiving signals or messages.

2. Emitting Events: An object created from the Event Emitter class can send out, or 'emit', events. These events are identified by a name (like 'click', 'error', 'data', etc.).

3. Listening for Events: Other parts of your program can 'listen' for these events. When an event is emitted, the corresponding listener functions (also known as 'handlers') that were set up to react to that specific event are automatically called.

4. They are perfect for handling asynchronous operations in Node.js, where you might not know exactly when a certain action (like receiving data from a server) will happen.

5. We can define our own custom events

6. It provides the foundational mechanism for emitting named events and registering listener functions (event handlers) that are invoked when those events are emitted.
